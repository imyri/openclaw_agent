// OPENCLAW MASTER EXECUTION MANUAL V4
// DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THESE RULES.

1. TIMEFRAME ALIGNMENT:
   - Monthly defines the overarching narrative.
   - Daily identifies the draw on liquidity.
   - 1H identifies the execution POI.
   - 5m is strictly for execution via MSS.

2. POI VALIDATION:
   - An Order Block (OB) is only valid if it resulted in an aggressive displacement leaving a Fair Value Gap (FVG).
   - A Balanced Price Range (BPR) supersedes a standard FVG in probability.

3. LIQUIDITY AXIOM:
   - Never enter a trade without a clear, un-swept liquidity pool (old highs/lows) as the target.
